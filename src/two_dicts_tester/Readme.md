This is a program that calculates the advantage of using the new dictionary againts the old one.  

**Usage**  
`./two_dicts_tester  -file_name_old %file_name_of_the_old_dictionary's_file% -file_name_new %file_name_of_the_new_dictionary's_file% -folder_documents %name_of_the_folder_with_documents_to_test% -result_file_name %file_name_of_the_resulted_file_with_one_number%`  
  
Result is the following fraction `score_of_new_dictionary / score_of_old_dictionary`.  
  
Smaller score is better since it is `size_encoded_file / size_file`.
